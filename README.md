# Hardware Description Languages (HDL) Course Repository

This repository contains lab experiments and VHDL codes developed as part of the **Hardware Description Languages (HDL)** course. The course primarily focused on digital design using **VHDL**, covering various aspects of hardware modeling, simulation, and synthesis.

## Contents

1. **Lab Experiments**:
    - Hands-on experiments demonstrating the design, simulation, and synthesis of digital circuits using VHDL.
    
2. **VHDL Codes**:
    - A collection of VHDL programs covering a wide range of digital design applications:
      - Combinational logic circuits (e.g., adders, multiplexers)
      - Sequential logic circuits (e.g., flip-flops, counters, FSMs)
      - Data path and control path designs
      - Memory elements (e.g., registers, RAM)

## Topics Covered

- **VHDL Basics**: Entity-architecture structure, signals, variables, and processes.
- **Combinational Circuits**: Implementing gates, multiplexers, decoders, and arithmetic circuits.
- **Sequential Circuits**: Flip-flops, registers, counters, and finite state machines (FSM).
- **Synthesis and Simulation**: Simulating VHDL designs using testbenches and synthesizing for hardware implementation.
- **Data Path Design**: Creating complex digital systems by combining various functional blocks.
- **Control Path Design**: Designing finite state machines to control data path operations.
